## Project Introduction
### Name: Simplified Bomberman  
Intended language: C/C++  
Summary: After learning the basic knowledge of C language, we are going to implement the simplified version of a classic game called bomberman by achieving the basic function of the game.  
Motivation: The Bomberman is a very classic game which was first published in 1983 and popular worldwide. After that, many other games with the similar mechanics are published and got popular in the early age of the web game. After learning some basic knowledge of Clanguage in this course, our group decided to implement a simplified version on our own so that we can both get trained and enjoy this classic game
